Today is my 25th birthday, and I've decided to actually start this blog. This is something that I've been putting off for a long time now. Constantly refining it to be perfect before I even start, I put it on the back-burner, then tweak it here and there, but never actually committing to starting it. I have this myth of the perfect blog, and when I fall short of that, I feel like I can't even write my first post.

So! This post is a fuck you to that mind set. As dev's we solve problems, we break something down into little bites that we can actually solve for, and then start from there. Then we move on to the next problem, and the next, and we never really stop. I can't speak for everyone in the community, but for me, unless there's a clear deadline on something, I will keep iterating on it forever. Often times making it worse than it was, and then have to clean it up, and I get stuck in that death spiral, and never actually finish something. Alternatively, I'll give my self a time box, and then feel like I've not actually finished it.
