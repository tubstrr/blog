<p>Hey, 🙋‍♂️ the names Jon and I'm a front-end dev based in Milwaukee. 
I work for an agency in Chicago, and been working with the web since <a href="https://github.com/tubstrr/first-portfolio">2015</a>. 
I've loved every minute of it <em>(asides from when I hate it)</em></p>

<p>I am self taught, and got started solely because I didn't want to go to college. 
After about 6 months of teaching myself to code, I realized I'd need to learn how to interview 😳  
I looked online and found a few agency's near where I lived and applied to all of them. 
My amazing Bootstrap template, and lack of experience didn't seem to impress anyone. 
</p>

<p>After a few weeks with no call backs, I decided to just show up at an agency and ask 
to speak to their hiring manager. Turns out it was just one dev, and the owner of the company. 
After a thirty minute conversation, the owner offered me a two week internship that turned 
into 4 years and a salary.</p>

<p>
	After I felt like I understood a thing or two about the web, I decided to move on and find a job that I actually wanted to be at. Currently, I've been able to work on some really cool projects, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
